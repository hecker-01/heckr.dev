## About

This is the site you're looking at right now. A Vue 3 single-page application themed around a terminal aesthetic using the Catppuccin Mocha color palette. It serves as a hub for my projects and technical write-ups, with a custom markdown rendering pipeline, live Discord presence via Lanyard, and GitHub integration that pulls repository and contribution data directly from the API.

Everything is statically served - no backend, no CMS. Posts and projects are plain `.md` files loaded at build time through Vite's `import.meta.glob()`, parsed with a from-scratch markdown service, and syntax-highlighted with Prism.js.

## Features

- **Custom markdown engine** - supports fenced code blocks with filenames, collapsible `:::details` sections, `:::hint` callout blocks, variable placeholders (`\$[name]`), tables, task lists, and auto-anchored headings
- **GitHub integration** - fetches all repos with language breakdowns, renders a 53-week contribution heatmap, and lists top repositories by star count
- **Discord presence** - WebSocket connection to Lanyard streams live status, Spotify activity, and VS Code rich presence into a neofetch-style status panel
- **Project showcase carousel** - auto-rotates every 10 seconds, pauses on hover, with per-project accent colors pulled from frontmatter
- **Tag filtering** - posts and projects support clickable tag filters synced to the URL query string
- **Reading time estimates** - calculated at 225 words per minute from raw markdown content
- **Page transitions** - fade + slide animations between routes with scroll position restoration
- **Console easter eggs** - type `help()` in the browser console, or try the Konami code

## Technical Highlights

The markdown parser works in three phases: extraction, inline transformation, and restoration. Block-level elements (code blocks, hints, details, tables) are replaced with `__PLACEHOLDER__` tokens first to protect them from inline regex passes, then restored after bold/italic/link/strikethrough processing is complete.

Hint blocks and details sections are parsed with their own renderers:

```javascript:markdownService.js
const hintStyles = {
  info:    { bg: "bg-catppuccin-blue/10",   icon: "i", title: "Info" },
  warning: { bg: "bg-catppuccin-yellow/10", icon: "!", title: "Warning" },
  tip:     { bg: "bg-catppuccin-green/10",  icon: "✓", title: "Tip" },
  danger:  { bg: "bg-catppuccin-red/10",    icon: "✕", title: "Danger" },
  note:    { bg: "bg-catppuccin-mauve/10",  icon: "●", title: "Note" },
};
```

The Lanyard service maintains a persistent WebSocket with automatic reconnect (up to 5 retries with backoff) and heartbeat responses to keep the connection alive:

```javascript:lanyardService.js
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.op === 1) {
    // Server sent heartbeat interval - start responding
    setInterval(() => {
      socket.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 3 }));
    }, data.d.heartbeat_interval);
    // Subscribe to user presence
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({
      op: 2,
      d: { subscribe_to_id: DISCORD_USER_ID },
    }));
  }
};
```

Projects and posts share the same loading pattern - `import.meta.glob` pulls all `.md` files from their respective folders, frontmatter is extracted via regex, and the raw body is cached after first parse.

:::hint info
The entire Catppuccin Mocha palette (20 colors from `crust` to `flamingo`) is mapped in `tailwind.config.js` as custom colors, so any component can use classes like `text-catppuccin-mauve` or `bg-catppuccin-surface0` directly.

:::details Router and page structure

The site has four routes managed by Vue Router 4:

| Route       | Page     | Description                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`         | Home     | Hero section, language counts, top repos, showcase carousel, contribution graph |
| `/posts`    | Posts    | Tag-filtered post list, opens detail via `?post=slug`                           |
| `/projects` | Projects | Tag-filtered project grid, opens detail via `?project=slug`                     |
| `*`         | NotFound | 404 fallback                                                                    |

Post and project detail views are not separate routes - they render inline when the query string contains a slug, which keeps navigation snappy and preserves filter state when closing a detail view.
