## About

Kitsudo is a local-first task planner I built for Android. It keeps the everyday flow simple: write something down, split it into smaller steps, set a deadline, and check it off when it is done.

The app works without an account or internet connection. Tasks and preferences stay on the device, reminders are scheduled locally, and the paired Wear OS app puts the same essentials on your wrist.

## Features

- **Plan in smaller steps.** Add subtasks and complete a whole checklist by finishing its parent task.
- **Stay ahead of deadlines.** Schedule early reminders, snooze them when needed, and set quiet hours for the night.
- **Keep the task list quick.** Swipe to complete or delete with undo, then sort and filter by deadline, priority, or date added.
- **Make it feel personal.** Use Material You or choose from five Catppuccin palettes and 14 accent colors.
- **Take it to your wrist.** View and complete tasks from the Wear OS companion without reaching for your phone.

## Local by design

Kitsudo has no account system, backend, analytics, or advertising. The Room database lives on the phone, reminders are handled by Android, and phone-to-watch sync happens directly between paired devices.

That keeps the app useful offline and keeps a personal task list personal.

## Technical Highlights

- Native Android app written in **Kotlin**.
- Local persistence backed by **Room**.
- A paired **Wear OS** app that can read and update tasks.
- Local reminder scheduling with early alerts, snooze, and quiet hours.
- A theme system covering Catppuccin palettes and Material You dynamic colors.

The project is open source and can be built with Gradle:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hecker-01/Kitsudo.git
cd Kitsudo
./gradlew assembleGithubRelease
```
