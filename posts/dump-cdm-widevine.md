This guide will show you how to dump your own Widevine L3 CDM using Android Studio and a virtual device, without needing a physical Android phone.

Download Android Studio here: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

:::hint info
You need a decent processor and at least 12GB of RAM. It runs on lower-end hardware, but expect it to be slow.
:::

## 1. Create a Virtual Device

Because Android Studio has deprecated suppport for API levels below 30, you will need to use the command line to create a virtual device with API level 28.

First navigate to the Android SDK directory. By default, it is located at by navigating to:

```txt
%localappdata%\Android\Sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin
```

Then open a terminal in this directory:

![android-sdk-location](widevine/01-android-sdk-location.png)

Then to download the required system image, run:

```bash
.\sdkmanager "system-images;android-28;google_apis;x86_64"
```

wait for this to load and it should say something along the lines of this:

![sdkmanager](widevine/02-sdkmanager.png)

Next, to create a new virtual device, run:

```bash
.\avdmanager create avd -n widevine28 -k "system-images;android-28;google_apis;x86_64" -d pixel_6
```

![avdmanager](widevine/03-avdmanager.png)

Now your virtual device is created, so you can start it via the Device Manager in Android Studio:

![device-manager](widevine/04-device-manager.png)

Click Start and wait for the device to boot. It can take a while.

Your virtual device is ready, and you can now proceed as if this were a real device.

You can now close the old terminal if you want.

## 2. Install Frida

Open a new terminal and run(assuming you have Python installed correctly, which I wont cover here):

```bash
pip install frida==16.0.2 frida-tools==12.0.4
```

![frida-install](widevine/07-frida-install.png)

Go to [https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/tag/16.0.2](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/tag/16.0.2) and download Frida server version **16.0.2** for **Android x86_64** (that's the same as the android image we downloaded).

Or you can click the link below to download it directly:

[https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.0.2/frida-server-16.0.2-android-x86_64.xz](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.0.2/frida-server-16.0.2-android-x86_64.xz)

![frida-server-download](widevine/08-frida-server-download.png)

Place the unzipped file in:

```txt
%localappdata%\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
```

:::hint warning
The frida-server version must match the version you installed via pip.
:::

## 3. Connect to the Virtual Device

Assuming you are in the platform-tools directory, open a terminal and verify the device is recognized:

```bash
.\adb.exe devices
```

![adb-devices](widevine/10-adb-devices.png)

Push the Frida server to the virtual device:

```bash
.\adb.exe push frida-server-16.0.2-android-x86_64 /sdcard
```

![adb-push](widevine/11-adb-push.png)

Open a shell, move the file, set permissions, and start the server:

```bash
.\adb.exe shell
```

```sh
su
mv /sdcard/frida-server-16.0.2-android-x86_64 /data/local/tmp
chmod +x /data/local/tmp/frida-server-16.0.2-android-x86_64
/data/local/tmp/frida-server-16.0.2-android-x86_64
```

![frida-server-running](widevine/12-frida-server-running.png)

:::hint danger
Keep this terminal open. Closing it stops the Frida server.

## 4. Run the Dumper

Download dumper from: [https://github.com/wvdumper/dumper](https://github.com/wvdumper/dumper)

:::details If that repo is unavailable, you can also download it from one of these mirrors:
GitHub mirror: [https://github.com/hecker-01/dumper](https://github.com/hecker-01/dumper)
Self-Hosted mirror (slow): [https://bittr.dev/hecker-01/dumper](https://bittr.dev/hecker-01/dumper)
:::

Open a second terminal, navigate to the `dumper` directory, and run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python dump_keys.py
```

![dump-keys-running](widevine/13-dump-keys-running.png)

:::hint danger
Keep this terminal open too. You now have two terminals running.
:::

---

## 5. Trigger the CDM

On the virtual device, open Google Chrome and go to:

[https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm](https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm)

Chrome will ask for permission to allow the website to access the DRM system. Click "Allow".

![allow-drm-access](widevine/14-allow-drm-access.png)

Play the video. The dumper intercepts the keys automatically.

## 6. Retrieve the Files

In the dumper directory, open the `./key_dumps/Android Emulator xxxx/pricate_keys/xxxx/xxxxxxxxxx` folder. You will find two files.

![private-keys](widevine/16-private-keys.png)

You now have the two CDM files:

| Filename        |
| --------------- |
| client_id.bin   |
| private_key.pem |

:::hint info
You can now delete the virtual device and all the files you downloaded if you want. You have what you need, and the virtual device is just taking up space on your hard drive.
:::

:::hint tip
To get a fresh CDM pair, create a new virtual device and repeat the process from step 1.
